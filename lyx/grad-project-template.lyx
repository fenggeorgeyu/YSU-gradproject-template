\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "sec:Methodology"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal in this section is to lay the theoretical foundation of the later
 sections.
 You will be doing a lot of computations in Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Analysis"

\end_inset

, and you will want to include here a discussion of each of the main procedures
 that you will be using.
 For example, if you are doing a project with multiple regression analysis,
 then you should discuss the theory of the regression model in this section,
 together with the model's assumptions.
 If your project is a cluster analysis of some data, then you should detail
 the algorithms/methods that were used and their properties and weaknesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use certain statistics to perform a hypothesis test or assess the
 accuracy of a particular procedure, then they should be quoted here (with
 their respective formulas).
 Again, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and make it clear why you
 chose them.
 If there are any special probability distributions that you are using,
 then you should include them here, with formulas, and describe their connection
 to the topic you are studying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Mathematical Typesetting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that you are a student in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics,
 the probability is high that you will want to include mathematical notation
 and formulas in your report, and they are entered into LyX using a special
 LaTeX math mode.
 There are three primary ways to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first way is called an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inline formula
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which means that the formula is included in the text with everything else.
 An example would be 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\sin x\ dx$
\end_inset

.
 This way is handy when mentioning variables or short expressions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second way is called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

displayed formula
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is separated from the rest of the text in its own displayed paragraph.
 An example would be
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\mathrm{e^{-x^{2}/2},\quad-\infty<x<\infty},\]

\end_inset

which is useful for longer formulas or equations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last way is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

numbered formula
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which displays the formula labeled with a number, for instance,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathrm{e}^{i\pi}-1=0.\end{equation}

\end_inset

There can be many of these in a the document, and the equation numbers will
 be generated automatically by LyX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please note that there are many, many, many things that can be done with
 LaTeX and mathematics.
 To get an idea, take a look at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LyX's detailed Math Manual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which can be viewed by clicking 
\emph on
Help
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset


\emph on
 Math
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, all variables, functions, and expressions in the document
 should be written in math mode.
 It is not acceptable to write X or Y when discussing variables in your
 report\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 they should instead be 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 so that the reader can easily distinguish between mathematics and text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Copying Material from the Internet (or elsewhere)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is yours, and the reader will assume that all of the words
 in it were written by you unless something special indicates otherwise.
 Take, for instance, this quote from Fox 
\begin_inset LatexCommand citet
key "fox02"

\end_inset

 which discusses the bootstrapping technique:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
Bootstrapping
\emph default
 is a general approach to statistical inference based on building a sampling
 distribution for a statistic by resampling from the data at hand.
 The term ‘bootstrapping,’ due to Efron 
\begin_inset LatexCommand citet
key "efron79"

\end_inset

, is an allusion to the expression `pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps'
 – in this case, using the sample data as a population from which repeated
 samples are drawn.
 At first blush, the approach seems circular, but has been shown to be sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the above 
\emph on
quotation environment
\emph default
 makes it immediately obvious to the reader that the words in the separate
 paragraph were written by John Fox, and not by me.
 
\series bold
Any passages that are copy/pasted into this document must be set apart in
 a quotation environment, just like the one above
\series default
.
 If there is 
\emph on
even a sentence
\emph default
 in the document that you have copied from the Internet (or elsewhere, such
 as a book or journal) which is not set apart and referenced, then you have
 committed 
\emph on
plagiarism
\emph default
, a very serious offense at this level of your academic career.
 Be careful about quoting external material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than copying someone else's writing into your project, it is better
 to read the material and write another version in your own words.
 Try to paraphrase the material into a shorter version that makes sense
 to you, or alternatively go in the other direction by adding explanations
 that the original author skipped.
 The goal is to make the passage your own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are exceptions: mathematical definitions, being one.
 These are quoted everywhere and are contained in many texts and references.
 It is not necessary to quote/reference a definition, unless the specific
 definition warrants otherwise.
 Ask your adviser concerning any cases about which you are unsure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

meat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the project.
 It is here that you present your computations, tables, scatterplots, diagnostic
 graphs, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-values.
 You will spend the majority of the time working on the results to put into
 this section.
 It is appropriate to include
\end_layout

 the types of the variables, and the format in which you received/collected
 the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 For categorical data, summary frequency distributions and bar charts or
 dotplots are appropriate.

 Assess the adequacy of your model with a measure of model performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do not spare any details for the reader in this section.
 If (s)he has a question about a statement made elsewhere in the paper,
 (s)he will come here to sift through the results for an answer.
 If the answer is not buried here, then the validity of your paper will
 be compromised.

\begin_layout Subsection
Graphs and Displays 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Analysis section will likely have many graphs and displays.
 Here are some general considerations to keep in mind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every graph should be labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Figure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with a respective figure number, and an accompanying descriptive title.
 If you are using LyX to typeset your document, then every figure should
 be enclosed in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Figure float
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in which case these labels will be generated automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every graph or display should be referenced in the main body of the text,
 and should have 
\series bold
\emph on
at least a paragraph
\series default
\emph default
 describing what the figure is and the figure's salient features.
 If you can't come up with 
\emph on
even a
\emph default
 
\emph on
paragraph
\emph default
 of important things to say about the picture, then the picture is not worth
 including in the project report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every graph should be 
\series bold
a maximum
\series default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 page in size, except in very rare circumstances.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
Some graphs are simply too big to fit in 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 page and still be legible without a magnifying glass.
 As of 2008, I have only encountered two graphs in graduate projects which
 I have supervised that merited their own page.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In addition, try to avoid putting two (2) graphs on one (1) page; rather,
 put the graphs on two separate pages and include a description underneath
 of each one.
 See the previous bullet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of a properly labeled graph is included as Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Scatterplot-of-after"

\end_inset

 (but the paragraph is missing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DO NOT COPY/PASTE TABLES FROM SPSS
\begin_inset Formula $\circledR$
\end_inset

.
 The tables returned by most software packages are overly complicated and
 are full of irrelevant information.
 If you have a generated table that you would like to include, take a close
 look at it and identify the essential information that you need to convey
 your point.
 Next, retype (or export) that information in a table, properly referenced,
 in the main body of the document.
 An example of a good table is included below as Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Tabular-results-of"

\end_inset

.
 Note that it has been enclosed in a 
\emph on
table float
\emph default

\begin_layout Standard
It is appropriate in this section to admit problems that you faced with
 the data, and limitations to your study.
 If the data do not support your original hypothesis, then say so.
 It is better to admit weaknesses of your study up front, rather than try
 to conceal them and hope that no one notices, or even worse, to ignore
 the weaknesses entirely.
 Spending time thinking critically and reflectively about the results will
 strengthen the project overall.

 you found.

You should collect all of the computer code that you used at any point in
 your project and post it in this section.
 There will certainly need to be some cleanup of the code to make it legible
 to the reader, but do not delete too much.
 The reader should be able to take the code from your project and repeat
 the analysis, verbatim.
 It is a good idea to make a final test-run of the code in this section
 to make sure that there aren't any crucial steps missing.
